# **Worldwide Bike Sales Analysis** 

## Background
With my intrigue in active living, I decided to analyze a bicycle purchasers dataset and  the factors that go into buying a bike vs not.

## Questions I wanted to answer through my Excel dashboard were:

1. How does income effect bike purchase decisions?
2. How does age effect bike purchases?
3. How does commute distance effect bike purchases?

## My Analysis

Based on the chart generated, both men and women who purchase bikes make about $4000 more annually than those of the same gender who choose not to purchase bikes. This would suggest that there is indeed a correlation between how much one makes and whether they buy a bike. However, people with higher levels of education such as a Bachelors or Graduate Degree appear to be less interested in buying a bike when making a higher salary. This would indicate companies would benefit targeting financially successful people with a lower education level.

When analyzing the age categories, the middle age people are buying bikes more often than not, as 388 people in this age range said yes to buying a bike compared to 331 who said no. Contrastingly, the adolecent and old categories both indicate a rate of purchase less than 50%. Based on the quantity of bikes sold and being a receptive age group, marketing to middle age people could be the most lucrative.

Bike purchases are consistently elevated for people commuting less than 1 mile to work, but between 1 and 10 miles, there is significant variation based on region. Bikes appear more common for long distance commuters in the Pacific while Europe tends to buy fewer bikes the longer the commute. North America seems to be a balance outcome between the two regions, staying steady up to 5 miles commute distance then dropping off in sales beyond that.
